        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake. As pleasing to the eye as it is to the tastebuds! It is especially good with a cup of coffee on the side.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>2 cups white sugar </li>
                <li>1 cup butter, softened </li>
                <li>4 eggs, separated </li>
                <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut </li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons baking powder </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk </li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Steps to make</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
                <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
                <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>

            </ol>
